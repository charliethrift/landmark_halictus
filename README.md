## Code: Contains code for data analysis in R
R Markdown file: In this document, we analyze variation in wing morphologies between two populations of _Halictus ligatus_ using geometric morphometrics. Necessary inputs for this script include:
(1) TPS files containing plotted landmark data for each wing photograph or "occurrence"
(2) CSV file containing bee occurrence data, used to match the TPS wing occurrence with its proper species and population information. Both of these inputs are stored in the Data section accessible below.

## Data: Contains CSV and TPS files necessary for running code
(1) TPS file. This contains the plotted landmark data for every bee wing photograph, or "occurrence." This was created using the TPS software suite developed by Rohlf. Photographs of bee wings were inputted, and homologous wing venation landmarks were selected. Coordinates of each landmark are stored in the TPS file.
(2) CSV file of bee occurrence data. This is sourced from the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. Citation for this data:
